Student Result System is an interactive web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to enter student marks and instantly view the corresponding grade and result status. The system processes the input marks in real time using JavaScript logic and displays clear, user-friendly feedback such as pass/fail status along with grade classification.
